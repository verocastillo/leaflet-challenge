## Background
The USGS (United States Geological Survey) was interested in building a new set of tools that allowed them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lacked a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope was that being able to visualize their data would allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet. This is where I came to help by creating a visualization map with the information provided by them.

## Results
Using the data obtained for the last 7 days by the USGS, I created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size, and also reflect the depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color. I included a legend with some context for the map and a title descriptive of the information in the map.
